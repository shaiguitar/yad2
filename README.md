## Yad2 RSS feed

Apparently something I wrote a few years back because I wanted to have RSS feed on http://www.yad2.co.il/ pages.

You should probably check @almog (Github UN) version of this which should be improved, if you really do find this useful in any way.

## Thats it

Yea, really. Nothing else.

## Install
